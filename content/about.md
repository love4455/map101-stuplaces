Three key pillars that will define ‘stuplaces’ are:

* Simplify: The goal of stuplaces is to simplify the end-to-end process of finding an accommodation. It will help students search available properties, view photos/videos, complete paperwork, and pay via the online platform. Landlords will also be able to list their homes online and complete the property verification process.
* Connect: The platform, stuplaces, will help bridge the gap between students and landlords and provide an efficient way to connect with each other. This way, parties involved will have the opportunity to ask and answer any questions with just few clicks. 
* Service: In addition to listing/searching properties and connecting students and landlords, the platform will offer various services that students can avail. Here are the key features or services that will be available:
  * Lease agreement – Students will be able to fill in details and sign lease agreement online.
  * Payment – Once an agreement has been confirmed, students will be able to complete transactions (security deposit, monthly rent etc.) via the platform. 
  * Pick-up – stuplaces will provide an airport pick-up service that students can opt-in and reach their required destination without any problem.
  * Settlement – Students will also be able to use the settlement services in which they will get any necessary articles such as food, grocery, etc. required to live for the initial seven days.
