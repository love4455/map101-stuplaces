      **Target Segment:** The focus of our venture, stuplaces, will be on
      international students who are planning to come to Canada for their
      studies. That covers students of any age, country, background. As they are
      not familiar with the new country and how to approach accommodation
      search, stuplaces will bring them in contact with property owners with
      available accommodations. Therefore, in addition to international
      students, landlords are also key customer for the venture. Stuplaces will
      be first rolled-out in Canada so we are targeting Canadian market that has
      seen huge growth in number of international students in the last couple of
      years. Colleges and Universities are also important clients in terms of
      partnerships and marketing of the product.


      **Customer Connection:** Once we have identified our customer base, we
      will reach out to them via social media platforms â€“ Facebook, Instagram,
      Twitter, and YouTube. Plan will be to have significant presence on social
      media to promote and answer any queries that students might have as they
      research the product. Stuplaces will also establish relationships and
      partnerships with colleges and universities across Canada to bring
      awareness of the product and how it can help international students.
      Multiple seminars and events will be scheduled with the existing
      international students so that they can promote the product via word of
      mouth to their friends and families.
