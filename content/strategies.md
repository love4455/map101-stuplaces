      **Differentiation:** Stuplaces will be developed based on the
      ‘Differentiation’ strategy because users will be able to complete
      end-to-end process on the single platform that no other applications
      offers. Also, partnership with colleges and universities will provide an
      edge over any competitors. 


      **Early Mover:** Stuplaces will be an early mover as there is no other
      firm in Canada that provides the complete services that the venture will
      offer. With the growth of incoming international students in Canada, this
      is a perfect window of opportunity to develop the platform and enter this
      market. The venture will be able to develop relationship with partners
      (colleges and universities) and have a strong impression on the platform
      users (students, property owners). In turn, that will lead to brand
      recognition and have a control in the Canadian market. Once the brand is
      established, it will be difficult for new companies to enter the space.
      Even if there are any new competitors, users or partners will not switch
      to them easily given the trust and relationships built with Stuplaces.
      Also, being an early mover will help the venture to learn from mistakes
      quickly and improve the platform without losing any customers.
